"""verbatim-citation-gate — catch fabricated RAG citations before they reach the user.

A two-stage, framework-agnostic auditor for quote-style citations:

* **Stage 1 — the verbatim gate** (:func:`quote_gate`): pure-stdlib, zero-token
  substring check that rejects fabrications, frankenquotes, and misattributed
  quotes for free.
* **Stage 2 — the skeptical judge** (:func:`judge_support`): a burden-of-proof
  prompt, wired to *any* model via an ``llm_call`` callable, that only lets a
  real quote count as ``supports`` when it establishes the claim at full
  strength.

Typical use::

    from verbatim_citation_gate import audit_citation

    verdict = audit_citation(claim, doc_id, quote, docs, llm_call=my_model)
    # -> "supports" | "partial" | "unrelated" | "contradicts"
    #    | "not_found" | "misattributed"
