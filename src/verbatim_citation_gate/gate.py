"""Stage 1 — the deterministic verbatim gate.

Zero dependencies, zero tokens. Before any model is asked whether a quote
*supports* a claim, this stage asks the cheaper, prior question: **does the
quote exist, verbatim, in the document it is attributed to?**

A bag-of-words comparison would pass frankenquotes — stitched "quotes" whose
every word appears in the source but whose sentence was never written. So the
gate matches the normalized quote as a contiguous substring. A real quote that
lives in a *different* document is flagged ``misattributed`` rather than
silently failing, which keeps that failure mode visible instead of collapsing
it into ``not_found``.

Because it is pure string work, the gate cannot be sweet-talked by a persuasive
citation, and every fabrication it rejects costs zero model calls.

    Applies Unicode compatibility normalization and case folding, folds

    Percent signs and decimal points survive because ``25%`` and ``0.5`` are
    load-bearing in the kind of quantitative claims citations usually support.

    The ordering matters. Hyphenation is repaired while the line breaks are
    still present; zero-width and soft-hyphen formatting characters are
    *deleted* rather than turned into spaces, since a soft hyphen sits inside a
    word and a space there would split it; and glyph folding runs after case
    folding so only lowercase mappings are needed.
